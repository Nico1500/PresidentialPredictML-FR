# PresidentialPredictML

## Overview

This project was a study on applying Machine Learning to predict the outcomes of the 2022 French presidential elections. Using regression and classification techniques, as well as testing boosting models, this work aims to understand how available data can be used to foresee the outcomes of French presidential elections.

## Objectives

- **Analyze data** available from the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) concerning the presidential elections.
- **Apply Machine Learning models** to predict the election outcomes.
- **Test the effectiveness** of various methods used.

## Key Results

- A **59% accuracy** was achieved using standard regression techniques.
- By trying **boosting models**, accuracy improved, reaching **89%**.

## Limitations

It's important to note that the accuracy obtained with these models is not guaranteed for **predicting presidential election outcomes**. Votes are influenced by numerous unquantifiable or unavailable factors in our dataset, such as current events, social media campaigns, etc.
